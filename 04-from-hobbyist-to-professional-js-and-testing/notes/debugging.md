## Debugging starting points

1) Open the javascript console in Chrome and follow the bouncing ball
1) Look for and examine red squiggles in VSCode, starting from top
1) Drop console logs/breakpoints in your code to see 
        - a) how far your code gets before it breaks
        - b) the value of your variables
                
        - What do you expect the variable values to be? 
        - Why do you expect it to be that way? Where do you make that happen?
        - Is the value what you expected? 
        - If not, why not? 
        - What would you have to change to make the actual value match your expectations?
